## Steps to run the code

1. Install `node` on your machine following the steps mentioned on the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/).
2. Clone this repository on your machine.
3. Open a terminal session in the root of the repository, and run the following command once:

```sh
npm install
```

4. Once the dependencies have been installed, run the following command to start the server locally:

```sh
npm run start
```

5. Now that the server is running, open `http://127.0.0.1:8000` on your browser to view and interact with the application. On making any changes to the actual front-end of the app (located within the /public folder), you would need to refresh your browser to view the latest version of the app on your browser.
